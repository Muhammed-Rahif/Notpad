## ![Getting started](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73386156/147833818-dca9fcba-c8a9-49ad-b961-66b7b813ef55.png) Getting Started

This project uses **semantic versioning** and **`semantic-release`** to automate versioning and package publishing. The project follows the [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) npm package, which automatically determines the next version number based on your commit messages and updates the release accordingly. 

Branches:
- **`main`**: Production-ready code
- **`alpha`**: Alpha and pre-release code

### Semantic Commit Messages:
While using semantic commit messages is not mandatory, it helps ensure that automated releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). You can learn more about the [semantic commit guidelines here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

### Steps to contribute:

1. [Fork our repo](https://github.com/Muhammed-Rahif/Notpad/fork) by clicking the fork button in the top-right corner.
2. Clone the forked repo to your local system:

    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Notpad
    ```

3. Navigate to the cloned repo:

    cd Notpad
    ```

4. Checkout the `alpha` branch (for new features and fixes) or `main` (for hotfixes):

    ```bash
    git checkout alpha
    ```

5. Create a new branch for your changes:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
    ```

6. Make your changes, then stage and commit them. If possible, follow semantic commit guidelines:

    ```bash
    git add <folder-or-file-paths>
    git commit -m "feat: add new feature to enhance performance"
    ```

7. Push your changes to the remote repo:
